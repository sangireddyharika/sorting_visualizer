In this project, I created a sorting visualizer using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. The tool allows users to visually observe how different sorting algorithms (like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.) work in real-time. I used HTML for the structure of the webpage, CSS and Bootstrap for styling and ensuring responsiveness across devices, and JavaScript to implement the logic for the sorting algorithms. The visualizer dynamically updates the bars representing data elements, showing the step-by-step process of sorting, helping users understand the efficiency and mechanics of each algorithm.
